# new-terrain-system-2018.3
In the newer version of Unity (Unity 2018.3, Unity 2019) there are some new terrain tools added. The terrain tools got reorganized a little bit so you may need a refresher tutorial video like this one to help get you started.  I go over a couple of things here: 1. unity hub 2. terrain paint tool and the combo items within  a. paint texture   b. raise lower terrain  c. smooth height  d. neighbor terrain  e. stamp terrain  f. adding speed trees to your terrain (paint details)  g. adding stones and pebbles to your terrain (paint details) 3. and the finally we add a player to the scene that we can walk around the terrain in 1st person view.
